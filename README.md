# NutrientTrackingForScaleHavers
Shiny App for tracking Micro/MacroNutrients

Encouraging understanding and tracking of what you are putting in your body,
with emphasis on micronutrients.






Add ingredients you have eaten / will eat, and see what nutrients you are putting in your body, with some idea of 
how that compares to generally accepted and your own dietary guidelines.

For home cooks with a scale, and the fitness community, and the general human.
